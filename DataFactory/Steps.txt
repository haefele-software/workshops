Create a Dev Data Factory
 - Connect Data Factory to source control:
    - github

Create Resource Group
Autorize AzureDataFactory

Added package.json to the folder that contains the Data Factory source code
Added publish_config.json (dont think this is nessary)
Add arm-template-parameters-definition
Setup validate with the npm install command
Setup build
Give access to AzureDataFactory
az ad sp create-for-rbac --name "sp-datafactory-workshop" --sdk-auth --role contributor --scopes /subscriptions/{subscriptionid}/resourceGroups/rg-workshops-datafactory-dev
Use the output of that in secret
-- This resource has been deleted left it as a example
{"clientId": "redacted",
"clientSecret": "redacted",
"subscriptionId": "redacted",
"tenantId": "redacted",
"activeDirectoryEndpointUrl": "https://login.microsoftonline.com",
"resourceManagerEndpointUrl": "https://management.azure.com/",
"activeDirectoryGraphResourceId": "https://graph.windows.net/",
"sqlManagementEndpointUrl": "https://management.core.windows.net:8443/",
"galleryEndpointUrl": "https://gallery.azure.com/",
"managementEndpointUrl": "https://management.core.windows.net/"}
I added that manually and gave access to a resource group
